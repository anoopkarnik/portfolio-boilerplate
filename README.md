# PORTFOLIO BOILERPLATE

*** PLEASE STAR THE REPO IF YOU ARE CLONING IT ***

## Overview

Every developer needs a portfolio. As the future of software is moving away from jobs to freelancing, consulting and solopreneurship. This is a minimal, reactive, portfolio of mine which can be easily modified, built using turborepo framework with next js packages

My Portfolio Website built using this - https://anoopkarnik.net

## Starting Locally

Clone the repo using:

```sh
npx portfolio-boilerplate@latest
```

## Modifying data in the code

### Using Constants

1) In apps/nextjs-app/lib/constants/, you can modify profile data section wise in the files.

### Using Strapi CMS

I have got it working on my site. Still working out the bugs to run them locally with 
typescript types already defined the the CMS
